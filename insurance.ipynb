    "We are a group of insurance salespeople who are trying to predict insurance costs.  We will examine relationships between gender, number of children and previous health concerns to determine correlations (if any). Specifically, we will disect two datasets to determine whether it's achieveable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance  \n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karimnahas/medicaldata  \n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Cleansing/Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets are CSV files where we will extract the data into DataFrames before analyzation.  \n",
    "Both datasets were fairly clean upon extraction ie. no null values, therefore, we did not have to delete any rows/columns.  \n",
    "We had to create primary keys for both due to neither dataset having one.  \n",
    "All column headings were converted to lower case to ease use with SQL.  SQL is case-sensitive and requires double quotes if in mixed-case.  \n",
    "We added a field to the `insurance` table called `age_category`.  This column will house age ranges and assist with visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Schema is as follows  <br><br>\n",
    "<img src=\"Images\\schema.jpg\" heigh=500 width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets were delivered to a PgAdmin 4 server to assist with sharing with team members.  These non-relational databases will be stored for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "That data failed to answer our initial question 'Can we predict insurance premiums?'.  The `insurance` table contains a sample of the population (1300 records) and doesnt yield enough information to extrapolate anything concrete.  However, if this sample dataset is a representation of the population then we can conclude that male insurance premiums are higher than females.\n",

    "We will be using a non-relational database and we will load the data into PgAdmin 4. We were able to clean the data to show the age ranges and insured individual who are smokers. The following is an explanation of our process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Extraction, in which raw data is pulled from a source or multiple sources. Data could come from transactional applications, such as customer relationship management (CRM) data from Salesforce or enterprise resource planning (ERP) data from SAP, or Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that gather readings from a production line or factory floor operation, for example. To create a data warehouse, extraction typically involves combining data from these various sources into a single data set and then validating the data with invalid data flagged or removed. Extracted data may be several formats, such as relational databases, XML, JSON, and others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Transformation, in which data is updated to match the needs of an organization and the requirements of its data storage solution. Transformation can involve standardizing (converting all data types to the same format), cleansing (resolving inconsistencies and inaccuracies), mapping (combining data elements from two or more data models), augmenting (pulling in data from other sources), and others. During this process, rules and functions are applied, and data cleansed to prevent including bad or non-matching data to the destination repository. Rules that could be applied include loading only specific columns, deduplicating, and merging, among others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Loading, in which data is delivered and secured for sharing, making business-ready data available to other users and departments, both within the organization and externally. This process may include overwriting the destination’s existing data. https://www.snowflake.com/guides/what-etl Snowflake What is ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)? Learn what is ETL (extract, transform, load) process and how it compares against more modern data movement processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could not perform an ERD schemata because there is no primary key to join the datasets. We would like to find the link between the comorbidities and the cost of insurance; however, these datasets are too small to extrapolate anything concrete. More information is needed. \n"
